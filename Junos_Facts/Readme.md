# Junos Fact Playbook

This is our working repositoru of Ansible that successfully gather Facts from Juniper Device using NETCONF. This folder has everything you need to run
GET_FACTS module on Juniper Devices. This document does not include environment dependencies setup to run Ansible and NETCONF successfully, however, I will add
that later to this repo for more complete setup.
